						<h1>Choosing a storyline</h1>
						<p>It takes lots of creativity to come up with a story, so here's all the inspiration you need!</p>
					</header>

						<!-- Content -->
							<section id="content" class="main">

								<h2>Starting out the ideas</h2>
								<p>You want an idea of your story. Which big events will happen in the storyline? What will happen that affects the characters? What is the idea of this story, and what message is it going to deliver to the reader?</p>
								<p>Where does your story take place? You need to think of all the big and important things.Your characters matter too, whether it's an animal, human, or somethig else. Characaters all need to be unique and have their own personality, appearences, etc. If your story does not have any characters, you can skip this part. </p>
								<h2>How will I write it out?</h2>
								<p>You've probably heard of organizing  the beginning, middle, and end. That is the next step after you've come up with the main idea of events. You wnat to start with details, such as where, why, and what happened when. The 5 W's are a big help when it comes to writing a book. If you need examples, grab a book story book off the shelf and take a look at it. How does the author describe everything? You want things to make sense. Think of how everything in this storyline can fit together, just like a puzzle, so that it turns out perfect in the end. </p>
